# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Using-Excel
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing HR data to identify key factors influencing employee attrition within an organization. Employee attrition refers to the rate at which employees leave a company, and understanding its underlying causes is essential for improving retention, minimizing turnover costs, and enhancing employee satisfaction. The dataset includes various employee attributes—such as demographics, job roles, education, and work experience—which are examined to uncover trends and provide actionable insights into attrition patterns.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a significant challenge for organizations, affecting productivity, morale, and overall financial performance. This project aims to identify the key factors driving attrition and uncover insights that can help reduce employee turnover. Specifically, it seeks to answer:
- What are the primary factors driving employee attrition?
- Are there specific employee segments with a higher likelihood of leaving?
- How do work-life balance, job satisfaction, and compensation impact an employee's decision to leave?
  ## Data Structure
  The dataset contains 1,470 records with 35 columns detailing various employee attributes. These include age, attrition status, business travel, daily rate, department, education, job role, work-life balance, demographic details, job satisfaction, and performance metrics.
  ## Methodology
  The analysis was conducted using Excel, focusing on various employee characteristics such as age, education, business travel, salary, years at the company, job role, and work-life balance. The following steps were taken to derive meaningful insights from the data:
  - **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Used Power Query to clean and transform raw data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraged Power Pivot and DAX measures to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.
  - **Correlation Analysis:** Examined relationships between attrition and key factors such as distance from home, years at the company, and job satisfaction to identify potential drivers of employee turnover.
  - **Data Visualization:** Developed interactive dashboards to present insights clearly, making it easier for stakeholders to understand key findings and take action.
 ## Key Insight and Discoveries
 - Employees with lower salaries are at a higher risk of attrition, particularly when coupled with low job satisfaction and limited career growth opportunities.
 - The Sales and Research & Development departments experienced higher attrition rates, with Sales facing increased turnover due to the high-pressure nature of the role, while attrition in Research & Development was primarily driven by limited growth opportunities.
 - Frequent business travel is associated with higher employee turnover rates.
 - Employees aged 18-24 with 0-5 years of experience had the highest attrition rates, likely due to career exploration, better opportunities, flexibility, or further education.
 - Employees with low work-life balance and job satisfaction were more likely to leave, highlighting the need for better workplace policies and engagement strategies.
 - Employees with fewer than five years at the company exhibited a higher likelihood of leaving, emphasizing the importance of early engagement and retention initiatives. New hires may feel disengaged or dissatisfied if their expectations are not met.
